Apex Legends Discord bot

Haven't coded on any personal projects in over a month and since I've been kinda obsessed with apex lately, had an idea to create a discord bot for it. For now current idea is to have map rotations on automatic reminders, mainly since I'm lazy to go in and check and then be depressed that it's king's canyon kek. Will see what other possible implementations after that's done
