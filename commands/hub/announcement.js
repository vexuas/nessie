    description: `Nessie is getting verified! Wohoooo ðŸŽ‰\nBefore anything, Iâ€™d like to thank a bunch to everyone who used the bot so far! I didn't expect a project I made for myself and friends to get to this point, I really appreciate it! <3\n\n**What this means moving forward**\nAs you may or may not know, Discord is enforcing [message content to be a priviliged intent](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-for-Verified-Bots). To put it simply, verified bots will no longer be able to read messages under normal situations after April 2022. As Nessie doesnâ€™t require any special cases in its functionality, this change will directly affect us meaning that Nessie will no longer be able to respond to prefix commands i.e ${codeBlock(
      '$nes-**'
    )}\n\nI understand that this is a big change, especially when Nessie was primarily only using prefix commands before; so to help with the transition I will keep support for prefix commands until **29th April 2022!**\n\n**Slash Commands**\nHow do I use Nessie now? Donâ€™t worry our friends in Discord has introduced a cool new way to interact with bots! You may have seen them before in your servers: Slash (${codeBlock(
      '/'
    )}) commands!\nInstead of writing a command in chat and getting a reply, you can now directly access Nessieâ€™s commands by writing ${codeBlock(
      '/commandHere'
    )}.\nFor example: ${codeBlock('$nes-help')} would now just be ${codeBlock(
      '/help'
    )}!\n\nMore information about Slash Commands [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ)\n\n**How to update Nessie**\nYou can get the latest version of Nessie by directly [re-inviting her](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=889135055430111252&permissions=3088&scope=applications.commands%20bot)! You will get access to Slash Commands and ongoing support for prefix commands.\n*Note that if you kick Nessie and invite her back, you will only have Slash Commands as I will only continue support for prefix commands for old servers*\n---\nThatâ€™s about it! Thanks again for using Nessie and hope you continue to! If you have questions, feel free to join our [support server](https://discord.com/invite/47Ccgz9jA4) :D\n\n**TL;DR: Nessie is getting verified so prefix commands will no longer be supported after April 2022. Instead you can [reinvite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=889135055430111252&permissions=3088&scope=applications.commands%20bot) Nessie to use Slash Commands**`,
